# Fibonacci
Hello and welcome. Hope the codes you find here help you. 
Please DONT COPY THEM BLINDLY.
The codes in this repository can compute terms from Fibonacci Series.

In the Fibonacci series the nth term is given by the sum of the (n-1)th and the (n-2)th term.

Main inspiration behind this program was to compute terms of the series which have large number of digits.

Theortically this program can compute terms of as high order as desired but is offcourse limited by the computational power of the machine on which it runs.

The nth iteration of this code displays the nth and (n-1)th term as follows :-
(n-1)th term : nth term

While storing, the separtor or the delimitter between the two numbers is '-1' which is converted to ':' on output.

I've included the codes that I wrote in JAVA and C++. I shall add the python code in the future.
